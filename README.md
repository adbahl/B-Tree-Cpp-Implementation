# B-Tree-Cpp-Implementation
Implementation of B-Tree data structure in C++

 The btree is a linked structure which operates much like a binary search tree, save the fact that multiple client elements are stored in a single node.  Whereas a single element would partition the tree into two ordered subtrees, a node that stores m client elements partition the tree into m + 1 sorted subtrees.
